## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript**
* **Boxicons** (for icons)

---

## 📌 How It Works

### 🔄 Switching Between Forms

JavaScript toggles classes to animate and slide between **Login** and **Register** views:

* Clicking **Sign Up** switches to the registration form
* Clicking **Sign In** switches back to the login form

### 🎨 Animations

Custom CSS animations use variables like:

```css
--D: 0;
--S: 21;
```

These control **delay and speed**, giving each element a staggered animation effect.
